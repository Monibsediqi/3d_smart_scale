############## Smart Scale Project ####################
## Summary
In this project I designed, developed, and deployed a pig smart scale android application utilizing various sophisticated algorithms and technologies. The app is mainly used to estimate the weight of a pig from its 3D scanned image. A scanner is attached to the backside of the device to capture 3D image of the pig. The image from the scanner is accessed via openNI library. I deploy openGL library for the 3D visualization of the pig using point clouds. I develop regression formulas to find the weight of a pig from the girth and length of it using a a collected pig dataset. During the development I used clustering, consensus and alignment algorithms to detects anomalies, align the pig, and reduce the prediciton processing time. The algorithm is deployed in an android device and SQLit is used to store the result of estimation inside the android device  further analysis. I deployed post-processing techniques to draw a productivity graph of the pig. The application is tested and validated using Samsung Tab S3 with a processing time of 7 seconds and weight estimation accuracy of 97%.
